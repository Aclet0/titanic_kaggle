Here is the jupyter project I developped to solve titanic kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview)

Best kaggle score: 0.79425

Best kaggle position: 1883/12367

Goal of this notebook is to go through data vizualisation on features , feature preprocessing (null values, normalization) and to test main ML model(LogisticRegression, LinearSVC, SVC, RandomForestClassifier, XGBClassifier) with Grid Search.
